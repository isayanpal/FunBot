## Inspiration
Many a times, we experience boredom, and a fun way to overcome that is by playing fun games that acts a stimulation to our brains.
## What it does
Our website has 3 games to choose from: Memorabilia which is the Memory Game, Block Game where there are bocks and a ball to hit the blocks. There is a platform to catch the ball, and if the ball misses the platform, then a pop-up is shown that Game is Over. Also, the scores can be seen, and there is an option to Reset the game. The third game is the Snake Game where there is a snake and its food. As the snake eats the food, the snake will grow in size. There is also a refresh option, and an option to see score. 
## How we built it
We built the games using Javascript, and for the styling we used CSS, Bootstrap.
## Challenges we ran into
The challenges we ran into were centering the canvas in the Block Game, adding the flipping cards response in the Memory Game, and we also faced challenges in github while trying to merge and pull the branches we created.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we made three games that the users can play and use as a recreational activity. We are also proud to have coordinated well in this hackathon, and of solving conflicts together, and helping each other. MAking these games helped us to learn javascript in a broader sense, and that we are glad of.
## What we learned
We learned Javascript in a great deal. We also learned to an extent how to make the website responsive, and learned a lot about git and github.
## What's next for Fun-Bot
We are planning to add a game of chess and ludo.
